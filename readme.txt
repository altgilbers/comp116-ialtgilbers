* What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
- encourage our use of industry standard source control tool
- allow us to have a portfolio of work done in this course


* What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

I really like the CTF game.  It was a nice challenge...  I wish we had more time to work on it together, because my team got stuck pretty quick and floundered quite a while.  I ended up solving most of it on my own at home that  night.

* How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I think I had a decent grasp on the fundamentals of security going into the course based on my professional experience as a sysadmin, but I deal with a small corner of the worlds of technology in my work.  This course exposed me to some new ideas and new technologies (how had I never used Kali before!?).   The MITM proxy demo with the iPhone was another example of something that broadened my perspective and reminded me how scary this world is from an information security perspective.


* What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
You can't trust anyone...  Sad but true.   XSS and XSRF are both issues based on trust...  Input validation (i.e. sql injection) is an issue becuase you can't trust anyone.  Cryptography mainly exists because you can't trust anyone.  Dynamic/Static analysis tools exist partially because you can't even trust yourself!  Privacy is a big issue because you can't trust anyone with your personal information

* Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I'm always interested in learning anything that can help me professionally.  I'd like to keep up on the OWASP lists and do whatever I can to stay current.   For a deeper dive, I'm hoping to get more experience with using Docker to actually run some services and learn more about the real world security implications.
